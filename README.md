This is a very simple bulletin board program that allows you to set events that are important and calculate how many days
are left until that event.

the events are set in the events.txt file with the form of day, month, year and message one after another and the date in
clear numbers. all of them must be sepparated by commas(,) for the program to work. also both files need to be in the same
directory for the program to work.

the program is infinite and will never close on itself (unless you tell it to).
